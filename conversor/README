gmn2midi, Version 1.0
(c) 1998 by Ludger Martin and Holger H. Hoos 

gmn2midi is a GUIDO to MIDI converter based on the GUIDO/NoteAbility parser 
interface. It concerts files from the GUIDO Music Notation Format
into the MIDI format. For more information on GUIDO Music Notation,
please visit the GUIDO Music Notation Page at:
  http://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/AFS/GUIDO

To call gmn2midi use the syntax
  gmn2midi [options] <filename>
or
  gmn2midi [options] <filename>.gmn

To get information on all possible options, type 
  gmn2midi

By default, gmn2midi reads the configuration file "gmn2midi.cfg". This file
may contain an arbitrary number of command line options supported by gmn2midi. 
Each option must start in a new line. Comment lines can be specified by 
using % as the fist character, this can be easily used to comment out options
from the configuration file.

Updates and future versions of this program will be made available 
on the GUIDO Music Notation Page at:
  http://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/AFS/GUIDO
